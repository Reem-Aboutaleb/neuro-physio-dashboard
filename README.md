🎯 WHAT THIS APP DOES

💓 PPG Signal Viewer  
→ View a clean photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal with amplitude patterns

📈 Peak Detection + Heart Rate  
→ Automatically detect pulse peaks and estimate beats per minute (BPM)

🧠 EEG Viewer  
→ Simulate brainwave activity across Alpha and Beta bands — visualize 2 seconds of synthetic EEG

🔬 Stress Classifier  
→ Real-time machine learning model classifies calm vs stress based on signal features

📂 Upload Your Signal  
→ Bring your own data (.csv) and explore it directly inside the app

📤 Download Report  
→ Instantly download a summary of your session as a .csv for research or analysis
